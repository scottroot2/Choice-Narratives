# Your Quest Book Project

This idea is modeled off of the old [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://www.cyoa.com/) books, but revamped for today's tech!  Basically we imagine a means in which both authors and readers can connect over these meaningful choices in a book.  

There would likely be an author experience where authors can supply text to begin with, pictures and other media later on, and the choice "paths" one can decide to go down as readers interact with the author's story.

Readers would be presented with an experience akin to an e-reader with UI elements for interacting via choices that route you down the predetermined paths.

Some possible features over time may include:
- Multimedia like background music, voice narration that isn't robotic, images/gifs/videos
- Mini games that may indicate chance encounters (dice rolls or something more sophisticated?)
- Community sharing portal to discover
- Definition of an open choice book format OCBF (lol)?

We are thinking about kicking this off as an open source community project and need a good name for the Github repo, and we need to design some very high-level architecture and what constitutes an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) scope to keep productive without becoming overwhelmed by good ideas.
